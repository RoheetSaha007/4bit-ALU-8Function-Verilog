# 4bit-ALU-8Function-Verilog
A foundational 4-bit, 8-function Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed in Verilog (RTL). This project includes a complete, self-checking testbench for ModelSim that verifies all 8 operations (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, INC, DEC) and critical status flags (zero, carry, overflow).
